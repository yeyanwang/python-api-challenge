# python-api-challenge

The **WeatherPy** directory contains 2 Jupyter Source Files **WeatherPy.ipynb** and **VacationPy.ipynb** which request relevant data from 2 API providers **OpenWeatherMap** and **Geoapify** for over 500 cities within the desired coordinates. The two Jupyter Source Files utilize Pandas library to create DataFrame for each dataset. Matplotlib library was imported to create series of scatter plots based on different variables. Scipy and linregress were also imported to help with statistical computation and generate linear regresssion line for the data points. Citipy was imported to generate list of cities with the coordinates, hvplot was imported for interactive data visualization, and geoviews is imported to explore and visualize data geographically.
