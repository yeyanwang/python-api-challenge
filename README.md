# python-api-challenge

The **WeatherPy** directory contains 2 Jupyter Source Files **WeatherPy.ipynb** and **VacationPy.ipynb** which fetch relevant data from OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify for over 500 cities within the provided coordinates. The two Jupyter Source Files utilize Pandas library to create DataFrame for each dataset, matplotlib library to create series of scatter plots based on different variables. Scipy and linregress are also imported to help with statistical computation and generate linear regresssion line for the data. citipy was imported to generate list of cities, hvplot was imported for interactive data visualization, and geoviews is imported to explore and visualize data geographically.
